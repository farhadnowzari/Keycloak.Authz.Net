# Keycloak.Authz.Net

This library is created to bring the Keycloak's fine-grained authorization to C#.

If you want to learn more about how to configure keycloak as an authorization server, check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5g50CVRGv8) or if you are not a visual learner, check the [official keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html).

## Installation

This library is available in nuget and can be installed with the following command:
```sh
dotnet add package Keycloak.Authz.Net
```

**Note**: This is a dotnet 8 specific library.

## Why should you use this?

Well if you already know how the legacy `[Authorize]` attribute works, or how `.RequireAuthorization()` extension method for endpoints works, then you will have no problem to switch to something much more complex, but simplified enough so you can use it exactly the same as before.

For example the attributes and extension methods are changed like this:

* [Authorize] -> [Authz]
* .RequireAuthorization() -> .RequireAuthz()
